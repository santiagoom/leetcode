030_substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words

```
You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.

Example 1:

Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: 
[0,9]

Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoor" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
Example 2:

Input:
  s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
  words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: 
[]

031_next-permutation

```

Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).

The replacement must be in-place and use only constant extra memory.

Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

1,2,3 → 1,3,2
3,2,1 → 1,2,3
1,1,5 → 1,5,1
