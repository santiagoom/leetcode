You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit.
Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

What if the the digits in the linked list are stored in non-reversed order? For example:

(3 \to 4 \to 2) + (4 \to 6 \to 5) = 8 \to 0 \to 7
(3→4→2)+(4→6→5)=8→0→7
