1) Optimal Substructure:
This problem is similar to Rod Cutting Problem. We can get the maximum product by making a cut at different positions and comparing the values obtained after a cut. We can recursively call the same function for a piece obtained after a cut.

Let maxProd(n) be the maximum product for a rope of length n. maxProd(n) can be written as following.

maxProd(n) = max(i*(n-i), maxProdRec(n-i)*i) for all i in {1, 2, 3 .. n}
