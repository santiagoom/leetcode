1) Optimal Substructure:
We can get the best price by making a cut at different positions and
comparing the values obtained after a cut.
We can recursively call the same function for a piece obtained after a cut.

Let cutRod(n) be the required (best possible price) value for a rod of length n. cutRod(n) can be written as following.

cutRod(n) = max(price[i] + cutRod(n-i-1)) for all i in {0, 1 .. n-1}



length   | 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
--------------------------------------------
price    | 1   5   8   9  10  17  17  20
